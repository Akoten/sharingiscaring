# Sharing is caring
Simple AngularJS Social Media directives

#### Do not use! Currently still in development. Pull requests are appreciated of course :)

## Features

- Open Graph sharing directive using FB.ui()
- Normal sharing directive ('share' action instead of 'open_graph_share')
- 'Simple' directive that does not depend on the Facebook SDK but only on HTML
- Factory function for more control than with directive attributes

## To do before usable:

- E2E tests for directives
- Unit tests
- Only using the non-SDK dependent directive should disable loading of the SDK
- Twitter
